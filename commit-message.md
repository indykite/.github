# Commit message guidelines

A good commit message should describe what changed and why.

1. The first line should:
   * contain a short description of the change (preferably 50 characters or
     less, and no more than 72 characters)
   * be entirely in lowercase with the exception of proper nouns, acronyms, and
   the words that refer to code, like function/variable names
   * be prefixed with the name of the changed subsystem and start with an
   imperative verb. Check the output of `git log --oneline files/you/changed` to
   find out what subsystems your changes touch.

   Examples:
   * `net: add localAddress and localPort to Socket`
   * `src: fix typos in doc.go`

1. Keep the second line blank.
1. Wrap all other lines at 72 columns (except for long URLs).

1. If your patch fixes an open issue, you can add a reference to it at the end
   of the log. Use the `Fixes:` prefix and the full issue URL. For other
   references use `Refs:`.

   Examples:
   * `Fixes: https://github.com/indykite/jarvis/issues/42`
   * `Refs: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/space-in-parens.html`
   * `Refs: https://github.com/indykite/jarvis/pull/88`

1. If your commit introduces a breaking change (`semver-major`), it should contain an explanation about the reason of the breaking change, which situation would trigger the breaking change and what is the exact change.

Sample complete commit message:

```text
athena: explain the commit in one line

The body of the commit message should be one or more paragraphs, explaining
things in more detail. Please word-wrap to keep columns to 72 characters or
less.

Fixes: https://github.com/indykite/jarvis/issues/42
Refs: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/space-in-parens.html
```
